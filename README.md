# German Market Helper

A small utility to fix some weird German Market settings/features.

Currently it only enables KUR (“Kleinunternehmerregelung”) for German users and applies regular taxes to other countries as defined in the WooCommerce settings.

This plugin has no settings. If you neither need the requirement to apply taxes to other countries nor use the KUR, you don’t need this plugin.

## Requirements

* WooCommerce
* WooCommerce German Market
